==================

A portable, low latency, retained-mode GUI framework written in C++
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I started this library to make a portable, low latency and modern looking
UI framework, which may also be used in proprietary (closed source) applications.

It is specifically designed to display information with low-latency,
and at the screen's refresh rate. Special care is taken for making
it easy for GUI element to observe and modify data external to the GUI.

You can find a lot more information,
[documentation](https://hikogui.org/docs/hikogui/main/index.html),
[example code](https://github.com/hikogui/hikogui_hello_world/blob/main/src/main.cpp),
news and blog posts on the main web site: <https://hikogui.org/>

Features
--------

 - High level API to make simple desktop applications.
 - Modern C++20 library.
 - Retained-mode GUI.
 - GUI will dynamically track the state of the application.
 - Localization and translation.
 - Animation at the screen's refresh rate.
 - Themes; including light/dark support.
 - Editable key-bindings.

![Themes with dark and light mode](docs/media/screenshots/demo_dark_and_light.png)

 - Most or all drawing is GPU accelerated with Vulkan.
 - Text is drawn using kerning, perceptional correct blending and subpixel anti-aliasing.
 - High dynamic range and high gamut color handling.

 - Automatic application preferences storage.
 - Many support systems:
   + logging,
   + statistics,
   + text handling,
   + text template language,
   + expression language,
   + dynamic type system.

Example
-------
Here is some example code for an application with three radio buttons,
who form a set by sharing a single `value` observer.

```
int hi_main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    observer<int> value = 0;

    auto gui = hi::gui_system::make_unique();
    auto &window = gui.make_window(tr("Radio button example"));
    window.content().make_widget<label_widget>("A1", tr("radio buttons:"));
    window.content().make_widget<radio_button_widget>("B1", tr("one"), value, 1);
    window.content().make_widget<radio_button_widget>("B2", tr("two"), value, 2);
    window.content().make_widget<radio_button_widget>("B3", tr("three"), value, 3);

    return gui->loop();
}
```
