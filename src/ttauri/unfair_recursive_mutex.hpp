/** An unfair recursive-mutex
 * This is a fast implementation of a recursive-mutex which does not fairly
 * arbitrate between multiple blocking threads. Due to the unfairness it is
 * possible that blocking threads will be completely starved.
 * 
 * This recursive-mutex however does block on a operating system's
 * futex/unfair_mutex primitives and therefor thread priority are properly
 * handled.
 * 
 * On windows and Linux the compiler generally emits the following sequence
 * of instructions:
 *  + non-recursive:
 *     - lock(): LEA, 2*MOV r,[]; CMP; JNE; MOV r,#; unfair_mutex.lock(); 2*MOV [],r
 *     - unlock(): ADD [],-1; JNE (skip); XOR r,r; MOV [],r; unfair_mutex.unlock()
 *  + recursive:
 *     - lock(): LEA, 2*MOV r,[]; CMP; JNE (skip); LEA, INC [], JMP
 *     - unlock(): ADD [],-1; JNE
 *
