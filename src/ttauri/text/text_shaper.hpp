 *  2. Fold default glyphs to a certain width by inserting line-separators.
 *  3. Run unicode bidirectional algorithm.
 *  4. Reload glyphs and metrics of any brackets.
 *  5. Morph glyphs.

    /** Construct a text_shaper with a text and alignment.
     *
     * The constructor will load all the default glyphs for the text.
     *
     * Horizontal alignment is done for each line independent of the writing direction.
     * This allows labels to remain aligned in the same direction on the user-interface
     * even when the labels have translations in different languages.
     *
     * Label widgets should flip the alignment passed to the text shaper when the
     * user interface is mirrored.
     *
     * Text edit fields may want to change the alignment of the text depending on the
     * dominant writing direction, for more natural typing.
     *
     * Vertical alignment of the text determines what y=0 means:
     *  - top: y = 0 is the base-line of the first line, all other lines are at y < 0.
     *  - bottom: y = 0 is the base-line of the last line, all other lines are at y > 0.
     *  - middle, odd: y = 0 is the base-line of the middle line.
     *  - middle, even: y = 0 is half way between the base-lines of the middle two lines.
     *
     * @param text The text as a vector of attributed graphemes.
     *             Use U+2029 as paragraph separator, and if needed U+2028 as line separator.
     * @param vertical_alignment How the text will be aligned vertically.
     * @param line_spacing A multiplier to scale the distance between lines compared to the
     *                     natural line spacing of the font: ascender + descender + line-gap.
     * @param paragraph_spacing A multiplier to scale the distance between lines compared to the
     *                          line spacing after @a line_spacing argument has been applied.
