namespace hi::inline v1 {

/** A delegate which bridges widgets with data.
 *
 * Delegates for compound widgets may require multiple inherintance
 * with a diamond pattern. Please always use "virtual inherintance"
 * when inherinting from any delegate class.
 *
 * All member functions must accept a `widget_intf const *` as the
 * first arguments. The widget calling these functions should
 * pass in the `this` pointer, or sometimes the pointer of a
 * child or parent widget of compound widgets. Unit-tests may
 * pass in a nullptr.
 *
 * `<name>_delegate` classes have the following optional member functions:
 *  - `[[nodiscard]] virtual bool empty_<name>(widget_intf const* sender) const`
 *  - `[[nodiscard]] virtual <value-type> get_<name>(widget_intf const* sender) const`
 *  - `[[nodiscard]] virtual bool mutable_<name>(widget_intf const* sender) const`
 *  - `virtual void set_<name>(widget_intf const* sender, <value-type> const &value)`
 *  - `virtual void toggle_<name>(widget_intf const* sender)`
 *
 * The name of the delegate is included in each member function, so
 * that it is possible to do multiple inherintance of different types
 * of delegates. Useful for compound widgets.
 *
 * @note Always use virtual inherintance with delegates.
