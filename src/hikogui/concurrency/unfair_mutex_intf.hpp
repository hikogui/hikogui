/** An unfair mutex
 * This is a fast implementation of a mutex which does not fairly arbitrate
 * between multiple blocking threads. Due to the unfairness it is possible
 * that blocking threads will be completely starved.
 *
 * This mutex however does block on a operating system's futex/unfair_mutex
 * primitives and therefor thread priority are properly handled.
 *
 * On windows and Linux the compiler generally emits the following sequence
 * of instructions:
 *  + non-contented:
 *     - lock(): MOV r,1; XOR r,r; LOCK CMPXCHG; JNE (skip)
 *     - unlock(): LOCK XADD [],-1; CMP; JE
 *
 * @ingroup concurrency
 * @tparam UseDeadLockDetector true when the unfair_mutex will use the deadlock detector.
