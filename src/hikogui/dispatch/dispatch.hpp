 * @brief Asynchronous dispatching and co-routine tasks.
 *
 * The Dispatch Loop
 * -----------------
 * Each thread has a local dispatch loop, which can be accessed using
 * the static function `hi::loop::local()`, which will return a `hi::loop`
 * instance.
 *
 * There are also two well-known loops which can be accessed using the
 * static functions `hi::loop::main()` and `hi::loop::timer()`.
 *
 * The main-loop is used to handle events from the GUI, Audio-control and
 * network. The main-loop is latency sensitive and any event should be
 * handled quickly.
 *
 * The timer-loop is less latency sensitive and can be used for slower
 * maintenace tasks, such as: high-resolution clock synchronization and logging
 * of telemetry.
 *
 * To "pump" the events you can use either `hi::loop::resume_once()` which
 * will handle events for one iteration; or `hi::loop::resume()` which
 * will handle events until exit is requested, or until there are no more
 * event handlers registered.
 *
 * Currently you will need to use `hi::loop::resume()` to handle the GUI
 * system. One windows a complex setup of threads and priorities is needed
 * to properly handle redraws, windows-events and networking on the same
 * thread which is setup by `hi::loop:resume()`.
 *
 * Coroutines and Awaitables
 * -------------------------
 * HikoGUI implements a asynchronous task called hi::task. There are two forms;
 * the default is unscoped where the task will continue even if the hi::task
 * object is destroyed. The second is a scoped task, with the
 * alias hi::scoped_task, which will destroy a running task when
 * the hi::task object is destroyed.
 *
 * A hi::task can await on objects that match the concept
 * hi::convertible_to_awaitable. This handles:
 *  - An object that is awaitable, i.e. with the full set of await_*() member functions.
 *  - An object that has a `operator co_await()` operator member function.
 *  - An object that has a `operator co_await()` operator free function.
 *  - An object for which hi::awaitable_cast<> is specialized. This includes
 *    by default:
 *    + std::chrono::duration (including the std::chrono::literals).
 *    + std::chrono::time_stamp.
 *    + std::stop_token
 *
 * Async task
 * ----------
 * The `hi::async_task()` function will call a given function and run it
 * using `std::async()` and control it using a co-routine which loops
 * until the function as completed. If the function passed to `hi::async_task()`
 * is a `hi::task` co-routine, then that function is called directly.
 *
 * `hi::cancelable_async_task()` is simular to `hi::async_task()` but it will
 * take a `std::stop_token` and `hi::progress_token` to cancel and track progress
 * of the given function. The given function's `std::stop_token` and
 * `hi::progress_token` arguments are optional, and `hi::cancelable_async_task()`
 * will
 *
