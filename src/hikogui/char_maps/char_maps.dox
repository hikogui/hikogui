/**
\defgroup char_maps Character Maps

These templates are uses to convert between different character encodings.

You can also convert between the same character encoding, this can be done to
'repair' invalid encodings. For example when converting from ASCII to ASCII any
characters in the original string above 127 will be replaced with a
question mark '?' after conversion. For UTF-8 to UTF-8 invalid encodings may be interpreted
as CP-1252 and correctly converted to the unicode equivalent, or the replacement
character U+fffd.

Here is an example to convert a string from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8:

```
std::string latin1_to_utf8(std::string_view str)
{
    return hi::char_converter<"iso-8859-1", "utf-8">{}(str);
}
```

Currently supported are:

 - ASCII
 - CP-1252 / Windows-1252
 - ISO-8859-1 / Latin-1
 - Unicode UTF-8
 - Unicode UTF-16
 - Unicode UTF-32

It is possible to add character encodings by specializing `char_map<>` in your application.
