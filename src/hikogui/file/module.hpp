/**
\defgroup file File handling utilities.

This module contains file handling utilities:
 - `file` and `file_view` class to read, write and rename files.

File and file-views
-------------------
`file` is a [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii)
object holding an handle to an open file.
You can use `access_mode` flags to control how a file is opened:
 - reading, writing,
 - if it should create a new file,
 - truncate the an already existing file,
 - create the directories when creating a file.

A `file_view` is a RAII object holding a memory-mapping of the file.
This object allows easy and fast access to the data in a file, as-if
the file was a `std::span<>` or `std::string_view`.
