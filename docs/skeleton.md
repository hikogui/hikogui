# Skeleton Template Language

This template language was designed for code generation for different programming languages
including HTML. The language was inspired by [makotemplates.org](https://www.makotemplates.org/), but with
a simpler data model making it easier to do more complicated stuff.

## Data model

All assignments at the top level of a file will be added to the global scope.
All assignments inside an included file are also made to the global scope.

Inside functions, all assignments are done in the local scope of the function.

Loops do not introduce a new scope, all assignments within a loop will therefor be in either
the global or local scope, depending where the loop is defined. Some special read-only names
prefixed with one or more '$' characters are available inside the loop.

Functions and blocks exist in a special global scope which only contains functions.
`#function` or `#block` definitions which appear later in a file will override a previous
definition. By calling `super()` from within a `#function` or `#block` you can call the previous
definition.

## Expressions

The `hi::datum` class is used for holding and operating on all the data while executing
an expression of the HikoGUI template language. A `hi::datum` class can hold the following types:

 * Undefined
 * None
 * Boolean
 * Integer
 * Decimal
 * Float
 * String
 * URL
 * Vector
 * Map

### Subexpression

Expressions can be enclosed inside parenthesis '(' ')' to force precedence on the expression inside.

 | 17         | expr '!' name          | String filter                        |

### Function call

Call a function with zero or more arguments.

A function is a name in special global scope with functions.
Functions are build-in, passed by the developer when evaluating an expression,
or added in the template by the user.

Syntax: `name '(' ( expression ( ',' expression )* ','? )? ')'`

### String filter

The string filter binary operator '!' implicitly converts the left-hand side expression
to a string, and passes this string through the filter `name`, yielding a new string.

Built in filters:

 * `html`: html-encode the string.
 * `xml`: xml-encode the string.
 * `url`: url-encode the string.
 * `id`: Convert string to match `[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]*`.

### Assignment

An assignment operator is different from an inplace-operation. An inplace-operation will
modify a value of an existing variable. An assignment operator will create or replace
a variable at the current scope.

The current scope is either the local scope of the function where the expression is located. Or
in the global scope, if the expression is located at the top level (outside a function) of a template.
Control flow will not introduce new scopes.

An assignment done in the local-scope will hide variables in the global scope with the same name.

Assignment can be done on multiple variables at the same time, by unpacking into a vector literal.

Syntax: `name | expr '=' expression`

Syntax: `'[' name | expr ( ',' name | expr )* ']' '=' expression`

### Null

Used by the user to denote a *nothing* value.

Syntax: `null`

### Undefined

Used by the system to denote a *nothing* value. This will be used
temporarily when indexing a vector or map on a non-existing key which may then be replaced
with a new value.

Syntax: `undefined`

## Escape, Statements and placeholders

Statements and placeholders are used to generate text.

To make it so generated text will not include unexpected white space, the following rules apply:

 * White-spaces, in front of a statement, are removed up to the last new-line.
 * The white-spaces and the linefeed after a statement are removed.
 * An escape can remove a new-line.
 * Text (including trailing white-spaces) is kept in front of a statement.

### Escape sequences

The backslash is used to escape:

 - End of line, mostly used for formatting inside loops.
 - The `$` dollar character used in placeholders.
 - The `#` hash character used in template statements.
 - The `\` backslash itself.

Example:

```text
This placeholder is suppressed: \${12 + 24}
This backslash is suppressed: \\${12 + 24}
This line\
feed is suppressed.
```

Result:

```text
This placeholder is suppressed: ${12 + 24}
This backslash is suppressed: \36
This linefeed is suppressed.
```

### Placeholder

The placeholder is an expression that is evaluated and explicitly converted to a string.
This string will then be inserted into the text.

Syntax:

 - '${' expression '}'

Example:

```text
${12 + 24}
```

Result:

```text
36
```

### Expression Statement

Expressions can be evaluated as statements themselves. This is mostly useful for
doing assignment, modifying data or calling functions with side effects.

An expression statement will add text to the output.

At the top-level, assignments are done in global scope. Inside functions and blocks assignments
are done in the local scope, even if the name already exists in the global scope.
Loops do not introduce scopes.

Syntax:

 - '#' expression

If the expression starts with a keyword such as `if`, `while`, `return`, etc. A white space should be inserted
between the '#' and the expression.

Example:

```text
#foo = 42
# [foo, bar] = [foo + 2, 2]
${foo} ${bar}
```

Result:

```text
44 2
```

### Including files

The `#include` statement is evaluated during parsing, by parsing the included file at the current position
recursively. An `#include` statement can only appear at the top-level of each file, i.e. it can not be used
inside the body of a flow-control statement.

Functions and blocks that are included by the `#include` statements are available in the global scope. See
the data model chapter.

The filename is an expression, this expression is evaluated during parsing.
When the filename argument is relative, the file is located relative to the current file.

It is recommended that the included files have the `.tti` (HikoGUI Include) extension,
and top-level template files have the `.ttt` (HikoGUI Template) extension.

Warning: There is no protection against including a file multiple times or recursively.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;include' url-expression

Example:

```text
#include "foo.tti"
```

Result:

```text
This is the contents of foo.tti.
```

### If statement

Conditional `#if` statement, with optional `#elif` statements and optional end `#else` statement.
The expression in the `#elif` statements are only evaluated, if the result of the previous `#if` or `#elif`
expressions were `false`.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;if' boolean-expression '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;elif' boolean-expression '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;else' '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;end' '\\n'

Example:

```text
# foo = 5

#if foo == 2
Foo is two.
#elif foo == 3
Foo is three.
#elif foo == 4
Foo is four.
#else
Foo is ${foo}.
#end
```

Result:

```text
Foo is 5.
```

### For loop

A for loop iterates over the result of an expression. Each iteration-result is
assigned to the name in front of the `in` keyword, optionally the iteration-result is
unpacked into multiple names.

It is possible to loop over strings, vectors and maps. A string will yield a single character string
on each iteration. A vector will yield a value on each iteration. A map will yield a vector with a key
and value on each iteration, sorted by key.

When unpacking multiple names, the number of names must match the size of the vector that was yielded
on each iteration.

The `#else` part of the for loop is only executed when the result of the expression
has zero items.

Inside the loop, extra variables are available for convenience:

 - `$i` or `$count` integer index of the iteration
 - `$size` or `$length` integer index of the iteration
 - `$first` is true if this is the first iteration
 - `$last` is true if this is the last iteration
 - The extra variables created by an outer loop are prefixed with an extra `$`.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;for' name ( ',' name )* 'in' expression '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;else' '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;end' '\\n'

Example:

```text
#for x in [1, 2, "hello"]
The value of x is ${x}.
#else
The list was empty.
#end
```

Result:

```text
The value of x is 1.
The value of x is 2.
The value of x is hello.
```

### While loop

A while loop executes a block multiple times until the expression yields `false`.

Inside the loop extra variables are available for convenience:

 - `$i` or `$count` integer index of the iteration
 - `$first` is true if this is the first iteration
 - The extra variables created by an outer loop are prefixed with an extra `$`.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;while' boolean-expression '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;end' '\\n'

Example:

```text
# i = 0
#while i < 3
Iteration ${i}.
# i = i + 1
#end
```

Result:

```text
Iteration 0.
Iteration 1.
Iteration 2.
```

### Do-while loop

A do-while loop executes a block at least once until the expression yields `false`.

Inside the loop, extra variables are available for convenience:

 - `$i` or `$count` integer index of the iteration
 - `$first` is true if this is the first iteration
 - The extra variables created by an outer loop are prefixed with an extra `$`

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;do' '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;while' boolean-expression '\\n'

```text
# i = 0
#do
Iteration ${i}.
# i = i + 1
#while i < 0
```

Result:

```text
Iteration 0.
```

### Continue and Break

Stop executing of a block inside a loop, then:

 - `continue` with the next iteration of the loop or
 - `break` out of the loop

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;continue' '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;break' '\\n'

Example:

```
#for x in ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    #if x == "bar"
        #continue
The value of x is ${x}.
#end

#for y in ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    #if y == "bar"
        #break
The value of y is ${y}.
#end
```

Result:

```text
The value of x is foo.
The value of x is baz.
The value of y is foo.
```

### Function

Define a function that can be called in expressions.
A function with a return statement will simply return with its value.
A function without a return statement will return its textual-output.

It is not possible for a function to return both textual-output and a value.

Functions with the same name will replace the previously defined function.
The previously defined function is available as `super()` inside the function.
This functionality together with the `#include` statement can be used for
as a simple form of object-oriented-polymorphism.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;function' name '(' ( name ( ',' name )* ','? )? ')' '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;end' '\\n'

Example:

```text
#function foo(x)
foo is ${x}.
#end

#function foo(x)
bar is ${super(x)}.
#end

${foo(42)}
```

Result:

```text
bar is foo is 42.
.
```

### Return

Return data from a function

Syntax: 

 - '#&zwj;return' expression '\\n'

Example:

```text
#function foo()
    #return 42
#end

${foo + 3}
```

Result:

```text
45
```

### Named block

A block is like a function without arguments which is automatically evaluated
where it was first defined. A block can only return textual-output.

Like a function, a block can be overridden by another block definition with the
same name. The previously defined block is available as `super()`. This functionality
together with the `#include` statement, can be used for as a simple form of
object-oriented-polymorphism.

Syntax:

 - '#&zwj;block' name '\\n'
 - '#&zwj;end'

Example:

```text
1
#block foo
foo
#end
2
#block foo
bar
#end
3
```

Result:

```text
1
bar
2
3
```
