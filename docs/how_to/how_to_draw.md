### Drawing rectangles

### Drawing rectangles with rounded corners

### Drawing circles

When drawing circles among rectangular objects it is recommended to
draw the circle at a 2-6% larger diameter, so that the shape seems to
be the same size and aligned to the flat edges of the rectangles. 

### Drawing slots

When drawing slots among rectangular objects it is recommended to
extent the flat edge by 2-6% of the diameter of the rounded edge,
so that the shape seems to be the same size and aligned to the flat
