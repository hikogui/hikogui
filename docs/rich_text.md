Grapheme Cluster
----------------

Text shaping and editing is done on a per-grapheme-cluster basis,
graphemes clusters are defined in "UAX #29 Unicode Text Segmentation".

Inside Hikogui a `grapheme` can be used in a `std::basic_string`. A grapheme
is 21 bits, where grapheme clusters larger than one code-point get a temporary and unique-id
assigned to the invalid unicode planes 17-31.

Text Style
----------

A text-style is actually a set of styles for different text-categories, languages
and scripts. The text-category is a mask, the language may be empty meaning a whildcard;
and script may be 'zzzz' meaning a whildcard. This allows for at least one of the sub-styles
to be a fallback.

 - filter:
   + language code
   + script code
   + phrasing mask
 - font family id
 - font variant (weight/italic)
 - font size
 - color
 - lines (under / over / strike throught).
