Perceptive correct anti-aliasing

Terms

### Linear-sRGB color space
Linear-sRGB is an inaccurate term describing a color space based on
the sRGB color primaries and white point, but with a linear transfer function.

The color component values have a range between 0.0 and 1.0 and are represented
as floating point values. In certain cases values outside the 0.0 to 1.0 range
are allowed to handle luminance values beyond 80 cm/m2 for HDR, or negative values
which represent colors outside of the triangle of the sRGB color primaries.

This is the color space that is used inside fragment shaders on a GPU.

### Luminance
The luminance is a physical linear indication of brightness.

In this paper we use the range of luminance values between 0.0 and 1.0 to
be mapped linear to 0 cd/m2 to 80 cd/m2; which is the standard range of
sRGB screen-luminance-level.

The luminance value is calculated from the linear-sRGB values as follows:

```
Y = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B
```

My intuition of luminance calculations on high-gamut colors is that
the luminance is always positive. Since if a color outside of the standard sRGB
triangle is selected at least one of the components must be a positive enough
value to force the luminance to be above zero.

### Lightness
Lightness is the perceptual uniform indication of brightness.

In this paper we use the range of lightness values between 0.0 and 1.0 to
be mapped non-linear to 0 cd/m2 to 80 cd/m2.  which is the standard range of
[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) screen-luminance-level.

The lightness and luminance value can be translated as follows:

```
L = sqrt(Y)
Y = L * L
```

The formula above is an approximation made in 1920, the current well accepted
approximation is closer to cube-root curve with a linear section for dark values used
in the 1976's CIELAB color space. However the square-root curve is accurate enough
for the use-case of anti-aliasing fonts and is much faster in hardware and easier to
use when doing the calculations for this paper.

The problem
-----------
As everyone knows alpha compositing of two images must be done in the linear color
space or there will be color and brightness changes over the range of alpha values.

If however we linearly convert the pixel coverage of an anti-aliased line
to an alpha value between 0.0 and 1.0 we get the issue that the perceived
width of the line is different between light-on-dark or dark-on-light.

Below we calculate what we will perceptional see when anti-aliasing a vertical
line of two pixels wide centered at x=2.25. On the left side a white line
on black background and on the right side the black line on a white background.

```
           white on black-background    black on white-background
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
coverage  | 0% |25% |100%|75% | 0% |   | 0% |25% |100%|75% | 0% |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
          
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
alpha     |0.0 |0.25|1.0 |0.75|0.0 |   |0.0 |0.25|1.0 |0.75|0.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+

          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
luminance |0.0 |0.25|1.0 |0.75|0.0 |   |1.0 |0.75|0.0 |0.25|1.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+

          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
lightness |0.0 |0.5 |1.0 |0.87|0.0 |   |1.0 |0.87|0.0 |0.5 |1.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
```

The perceived line width of "white on black-background" is:
`width = 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.87 + 0.0 = 2.37`

The perceived line width of "black on white-background" is:
`width = 5 - (1.0 + 0.87 + 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) = 1.63`

As you can see the perceived width of the line is significant different
especially when anti-aliasing objects which are thin, such as the lines
on a glyph.

There are some papers about the problems the change of thickness when
rendering black text or white text. Most of those papers say these problems
stem from not using linear compositing, or even hand-waving that the font
was designed for black on white.

However as you see from the calculations above this has nothing to do with
the design of a font, because it shows up even when rendering a single line.
Also if you would render the font without anti-aliasing these problems no longer
exist, such as when rendering with a high resolution printer.

The solution
------------
We want to anti-alias perceptional uniform between the foreground and background
color, while at the same time linearly mix the foreground and background using
alpha compositing. This means that the coverage-value is in perceptional uniform
space.

First we need to calculate the foreground and background lightness, based on the
final composite of the foreground and background color using the two alpha values
0.0 and 1.0. This definition will allow for semi-transparent foreground colors.

```
Yfront = 0.2126 * Rfront + 0.7152 * Gfront + 0.0722 * Bfront
Yback = 0.2126 * Rback + 0.7152 * Gback + 0.0722 * Bback
Lfront = sqrt(Yfront)
Lback = sqrt(Yback)
```

By mixing the foreground and background lightness using the coverage value, we
now have the target lightness for that coverage value.

```
Ltarget = mix(Lback, Lfront, coverage)
```

We can convert this target lightness to a target luminance, which can then be used to find
the alpha value needed to reach that target from the foreground and background luminance.
If the luminance of the background and foreground are the same, then that means only
the color is different, in that case linearly map the coverage to alpha.

```
Ytarget = Ltarget * Ltarget
alpha = (Ytarget - Yback) / (Yfront - Yback)       if Yfront != Yback
alpha = coverage                                   otherwise
```

### Example
Below we calculate what we will perceptional see when anti-aliasing a vertical
line of two pixels wide centered at x=2.25. On the left side a white line
on black background and on the right side the black line on a white background.

```
           white on black-background    black on white-background
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
coverage  | 0% |25% |100%|75% | 0% |   | 0% |25% |100%|75% | 0% |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
                                        ((1 - coverage)^2 - 1) / -1
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
alpha     |0.0 |.062|1.0 |.562|0.0 |   |0.0 |.438|1.0 |.938|0.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
                                        1 - alpha
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
luminance |0.0 |.062|1.0 |.562|0.0 |   |1.0 |.562|0.0 |.062|1.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
                                        sqrt(luminance)
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
lightness |0.0 |0.25|1.0 |0.75|0.0 |   |1.0 |0.75|0.0 |0.25|1.0 |
          +----+----+----+----+----+   +----+----+----+----+----+
```

The perceived line width of "white on black-background" is:
`width = 0.0 + 0.25 + 1.0 + 0.75 + 0.0 = 2`

The perceived line width of "black on white-background" is:
`width = 5 - (1.0 + 0.75 + 0.0 + 0.25 + 1.0) = 2`

sub-pixel anti-aliasing
-----------------------
During sub-pixel anti-aliasing we get a coverage value at each
sub-pixel location.

For a perceptional conversion of those coverage value to an alpha
value we are interested in the lightness of the full pixel after
compositing with the two alpha values of 0.0 and 1.0.

After that we have an alpha value for each sub-pixel, then we do
linear compositing on each sub-pixel separate.
