Install the HikoGUI development environment
===========================================

This guide explains how to install HikoGUI for developing HikoGUI itself.
For installing the HikoGUI library as part of an application see the
[hikogui_hello_world](https://github.com/hikogui/hikogui_hello_world)
example application.

Specific installation manuals for each platform and IDE:
 - [Visual Studio Code](docs/build_with_visual_studio_code.md)
 - [MSVC on Windows](docs/build_with_msvc_on_windows.md)

It is currently not recommended to use Visual Studio nor CLion with HikoGUI
due to serious issues, however it used to work:
 - [Visual Studio (Preview)](docs/build_with_visual_studio.md)
 - [gcc on Linux](docs/build_with_gcc_on_linux.md)
